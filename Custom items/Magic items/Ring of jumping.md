**When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump**. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.


The ring of jumping allows the wearer to add 10 ft to their jumpheight. it has no additional effects
