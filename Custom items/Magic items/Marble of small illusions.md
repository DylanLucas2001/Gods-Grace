Allows the wearer to make small illusions.

You create an image of an object (up to 5 cm in diameter) within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. The image canâ€™t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
